The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction.Clouds are free they come and go as they please. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. Let's have a happy little tree in here.

				<p>We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. It is a lot of fun. There it is. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage.</p>

<p>I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. Here's something that's fun. Imagination is the key to painting.</p>

<p>The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. Let your imagination be your guide. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be.</p>
